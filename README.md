Key themes and insights have been outlined and placed in social, cultural and legal context. 
A representative group of existing cognitive accessibility guidelines have been placed under initial review, a draft evaluation framework established, and next steps identified.

KEYWORDS: USER EXPERIENCE, SERVICE DESIGN, HEALTHCARE, SOCIAL CARE, HEALTH POLICY, DIGITAL INCLUSION, INNOVATION, COGNITION, DISABILITY AND LIVED EXPERIENCE.
